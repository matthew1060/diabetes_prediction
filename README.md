# Diabetes Prediction

In this project, we create a linear regression model which would predict/diagnose early signs of being diabetic or not for women. 

## Training
Given to us is a dataset called train.csv which contains attributes such as:

**Pregnancies** - No. of times person has been pregnant

**Glucose** - Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test

**BloodPressure** - Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)

**SkinThickness** - Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)

**Insulin** - 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

**BMI** - Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)

**DiabetesPedigreeFunction** - Diabetes pedigree function

**Age** - in years

**Outcome** - 0 or 1. 0 means person was not diagnosed with diabetes, and 1 means that person was diagnosed with diabetes

**ID** - unique identifier for the given person

## Testing
Given this data, and a series of new test data, the model produces a file predictions.csv containing the ID and predicted outcomes for diabetic patients of the test data.

This project is part of the Edyst Internship Program.
